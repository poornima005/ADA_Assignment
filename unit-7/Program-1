"""
To analyze the speedup and efficiency of this algorithm, we can compare the time it takes to run the algorithm on a 
single processor to the time it takes to run the algorithm on multiple processors. 
We can also measure the overhead associated with communication between processors, which can be a bottleneck for parallel algorithms.

In general, the speedup of a parallel algorithm is defined as the ratio of the time it takes to run the algorithm on a single processor 
to the time it takes to run the algorithm on multiple processors. The efficiency of a parallel algorithm is defined as the speedup divided by the
number of processors used.

To evaluate the speedup and efficiency of the Cannon's algorithm, we can run experiments on a multicore processor or GPU and measure the
execution time for different matrix sizes and numbers of processors. We can then plot the results and analyze the speedup and efficiency trends. 
We can also compare the performance of the Cannon's algorithm to other parallel matrix multiplication algorithms to identify the best algorithm for 
a given problem size and hardware platform.
