A Hamiltonian cycle is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once and ends at the starting vertex. 
Hamiltonian cycles are important in many areas of computer science, including network routing, optimization problems, and scheduling.

One real-life application of Hamiltonian cycles is in the design and planning of delivery routes for companies such as UPS or FedEx.
The goal is to find the shortest path that visits each customer exactly once and returns to the starting point, 
which is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph representing the delivery locations. By finding such a cycle, 
the delivery company can optimize their routes, reducing the amount of time and resources required for each delivery and increasing overall efficiency.

Another application of Hamiltonian cycles is in the design of integrated circuits. 
In order to minimize the amount of wiring required and reduce the size of the circuit, 
it is important to find a cycle that connects all the components in the circuit. 
This problem can be represented as finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph representing the components and their connections.

Finally, Hamiltonian cycles are also important in molecular biology, particularly in the study of protein folding. 
In order to understand the structure of proteins and their interactions with other molecules, 
it is necessary to determine the paths that molecules take as they move through the protein. 
This problem can be represented as finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph representing the protein structure.
