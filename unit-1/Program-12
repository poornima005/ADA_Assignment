11.  Create a flowchart for a binary search algorithm.

Start
|
V
Set low = 0 and high = length of array - 1
|
V
While low <= high
|
V
Set mid = (low + high) // 2
|
V
If the value at the mid index is equal to the target value
|
|---Yes: Return mid
|
V
If the value at the mid index is less than the target value
|
|---Yes: Set low = mid + 1
|
|---No: Set high = mid - 1
|
V
Return -1 (if target value not found in array)
|
V
End
