14.  Create a flowchart for an insertion sort algorithm.

Start
|
V
For i = 1 to length of array - 1
|
V
Set current_value = value at index i
|
V
Set j = i - 1
|
V
While j >= 0 and value at index j is greater than current_value
|
|---Yes: Shift the value at index j to the right by 1 position
|
|---Decrement j by 1
|
V
End While
|
V
Insert current_value at index j+1
|
V
End For
